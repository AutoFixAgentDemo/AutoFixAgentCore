# Base

This package is a modified fork of the MetaGPT library. We have introduced enhancements to improve functionality and usability. Specifically, we replaced the original Message implementation with a new version that includes label attribution and other significant improvements. Our modifications aim to extend the original libraryâ€™s features while maintaining compatibility and reliability.

When modifying the package, remember to use relative import to prevent unexpected error.
