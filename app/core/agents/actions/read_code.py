    You have been provided with a vulnerabilities report list which may contains multiple vulnerbility reports. Within this report, there is a mention of a particular function. Your task is to analyze that function and provide a concise report. Please follow these steps:
        1.	Identify the functions referenced in the vulnerability report.
        2.	Determine the purpose of the each function. Explain what the function is supposed to do.
        3.	Understand the implementation details of the function. Summarize how it is or should be implemented.
        4.	Write your findings in a final report, following the format instructions below and never ignore any functions mentioned in the report's sink point.

    Important:
        1. Your final output must be returned as valid JSON only. No code fence needed.
        2. Do not include any additional text, markdown, or formatting outside of the JSON structure.

    Use the following JSON format for your final answer as a list of a dictionary with the following fixed code:

    [{{
    "functionName": "Name of the function or the method which contains the sink point mentioned in the report",
    "functionPurpose": "Short explanation of the function's purpose",
    "functionImplementation": ["A list of key steps on how the function is or should be implemented"]
    }}]
    Return only the JSON objectâ€”no extra commentary, headers, or descriptive text.

    Below is the code snippet you need to analyze:

    {code_text}

    Below is the vulnerability report may contain multiple vulns:

    {report_text}
